# Github Mini Mastery Exercise

## Setup

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/quizzes/static-web/github && cd $_
```

This will create a project folder and cd you into it.

When you are ready to start the quiz, request the Github Classroom link from your instructor  

+ Once your repository is created on GitHub, copy the list of commands under **"..or create a new repository on the command line"** by clicking on the clipboard icon  
+ Paste the commands into your terminal. This will create a README.md file, add it, commit it, connect your local repo to GitHub, and set you up to push up the changes. (If the last command, `git push origin master` isn't automatically executed, hit enter/return to run it).

All of your quiz work should be on a branch, NOT on master. To do this, type:

```bash
git checkout -b quiz
touch index.html
```

You are now ready to work in the `quiz` branch.

When your work in complete, push up the branch (`git push origin quiz`) and submit the pull request on Github.

## Instructions

Create the index.html page and place your name in the `<body>` within an `<h1>` tag.

Complete the rest of the instructions to push your branch and submit a pull request on Github.

Once your pull request has been approved, you will merge the branch with the master and delete the branch.
